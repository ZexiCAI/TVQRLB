Description: This package is an implementation of the estimation and inference procedure of a quantile regression model which is based on an estimating equation, with time-varying covariates under length-biased sampling scheme. It fits a quantile regression model to the provided dataset where the covariates are viewed as time-dependent and the sampling is length-biased. The parameters are obtained by minimizing the Euclidean norm of certain estimating equations. For the standard error estimation, two inference procedures are used: standard multiplier bootstrap, and a more computationally efficient algorithm named "Orthogonal Procrustes" method, based on matrix singular value decomposition, is used.
